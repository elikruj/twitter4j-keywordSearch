Keyword Search

This project is able to pull a list of followers from a user, gather at most 3200 tweets from each of 
those followers, and check each tweet for a word or phrase (or multiple words or phrases). This project
could be used to better understand the fanbases of specific celebrities or politicians since the code 
scans a list of their followers to see what they are talking about. 

How to Use:

To use this code, you must 

A, have an IDE capable of writing and running JavaScript (I used Eclipse Photon, download here: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) 

B, have at least Java 1.7.1 (I used 1.8.1, download here: https://bit.ly/1lO1FSV)

C, you must download the Twitter4j jar files that allow you to use the methods necessary to gather the data 
from Twitter's  API (download here: http://twitter4j.org/archive/twitter4j-4.0.4.zip)

D, you must apply the twitter4j-core-4.0.4 (or 
twitter4j-core-4.0.6) jar file to your build path.

Depending on what type of data you are looking to gather, you may need to apply for a Twitter development account (done here: https://apps.twitter.com/)
This will give you the Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, and Token Secret found in the code.
